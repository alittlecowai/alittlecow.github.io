# üêÆ A Little Cow 
This is a simple web application with the following characteristics:
- Single-page Application
- Data binding 

The code base is based on React JavaScript and can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/alittlecowai/alittlecow.github.io).

### Single-page Application
Single-page applications provides users with a seamless web browsing experience when navigating to different pages of the web application without having the browser to load new pages.

Clicking on the above tabs illustrates this seamless experience. In contrast, clicking on [this link](/blog) to view the 'Blog' tab reloads the web page.

### Data Binding
As defined at [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-data-binding/), data binding is the process of connecting the view element or user interface, with the data which populates it.

Typing in the search bar above illustrates the data binding experience. Once there are 3 or more characters in the search query, the page content here will be updated. Available search terms now are `sample1` and `sample2`.
